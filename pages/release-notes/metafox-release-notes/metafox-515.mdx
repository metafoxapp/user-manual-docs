## What's new

## **Features and Enhancements**

### Monetization with E-Money 

We're excited to introduce our groundbreaking E-Money feature, designed to enhance your experience on MetaFox while offering you opportunities for financial growth. With E-Money, you can now seamlessly engage with our community and generate income while enjoying a secure and efficient payment system.

-   Supports Admin commission earnings, allowing administrators to earn a commission fee for every transaction that occurs within the community. All payments initiated by users within the community will be routed directly to the payment account configured in the AdminCP. This streamlines payment processing, ensuring that funds are securely and promptly received.

-   User accounts will reflect the paid amount after deducting the payment commission fee. The actual amount processed will be based on USD (United States Dollar) after being converted using the latest currency conversion rates. This ensures that users have a clear view of their earnings and expenditures. Users can manage their finances effortlessly within the Account Settings section. This includes checking their current balance, reviewing transaction history, sending funds, and monitoring withdrawal requests.

-   Admins play a vital role in the E-Money system by managing user withdrawal requests. Upon receiving a withdrawal request, Admins have the authority to approve it. Once approved, the Admin will be redirected to PayPal to complete the payment processing.
