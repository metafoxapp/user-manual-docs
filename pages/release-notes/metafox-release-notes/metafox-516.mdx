## **Core Updates**

### **Enhanced Server Compatibility**

MetaFox now smoothly operates on servers that do not support `allow_url_fopen`, ensuring a wider range of server compatibility.

You can now upload HEIC files, expanding your options for sharing and enjoying high-quality images.

### **Invite Code Registration**

Registering an account is now more flexible. Users can verify their accounts using invite codes, making the registration process simpler and tailored to various devices.

### **Activity Point Conversion**

Whether you've earned activity points through contributions, interactions, or community involvement, now you can transform those points into tangible value within your E-Wallet. The conversion rates as well as conversion fee are configured by administrators in the Admin Control Panel (AdminCP), ensuring fairness and transparency. We believe that this feature provides a valuable incentive for user engagement.
