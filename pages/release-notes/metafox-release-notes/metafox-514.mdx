### **Mobile Link Sharing**

Your MetaFox app will be listed in the Share options so users can easily share links from other apps to your MetaFox app, boosting cross-platform interaction. When users come across content on a certain app that they want to share it with your MetaFox, simply tap the Share button within that app, select MetaFox, and watch as the link is effortlessly integrated into your MetaFox. Say goodbye to the hassle of copying and pasting links – now, sharing interesting content with your friends and followers is just a tap away.

### **Apple Pay Support**

Apple Pay supports an advanced payment method for MetaFox, providing you with a seamless and modern payment experience. With Apple Pay integration, making purchases has never been easier or more secure.

**Simple Setup, Effortless Transactions**

Setting up Apple Pay on our product is a breeze. No need to enter card details repeatedly; with just a few clicks, you can authorize payments instantly.

**Swift, Contactless Payments**

With Apple Pay, completing transactions is as simple as holding your device near the supported payment terminal and authenticating with Face ID or Touch ID. Within seconds, your payment is processed, providing a smooth and convenient experience.

**Enhanced Security for Peace of Mind**

Your security is our top priority. When you use Apple Pay, your card information is never shared with merchants. Instead, a unique token is used for each transaction, safeguarding your sensitive data from potential threats. With the added layers of biometric authentication, you can rest assured that only you can authorize payments.

In this version, we have integrated the Apple Pay with the following MetaFox features:

-   Purchase packages of Activity points
-   Purchase Subscription
-   Supported payment processor(s): Stripe

### **Manage Pending Comments**

Keep your platform's discussions meaningful by managing pending comments effectively. Admins can seamlessly stay in control of user-generated content of specific user roles by efficiently managing their pending comments, and maintaining the quality and relevance of discussions.

### **Rewarding User Invitations**

We're enhancing user engagement by allowing members to earn activity points when they successfully invite others to join the community. Strengthen the bond between users and reward their proactive efforts.

### **Improved AdminCP Functionalities**

-   Add New Translation Phrases: Customize your platform by easily adding new translation phrases through the AdminCP.
-   Add New Countries, States, and Provinces: Tailor your network to specific regions by adding new countries, states, and provinces.
-   Configure Smart Banner for Mobile: Optimize the mobile experience with configurable smart banners that capture user attention.

### **Improved Payment Gateway Workflow**
