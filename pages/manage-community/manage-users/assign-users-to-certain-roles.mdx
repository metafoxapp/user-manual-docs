# Assign users to certain roles

This article will show you how to find and change the user's role. This assumes you are already logged in as the Admin user and are logged into **the AdminCP**.

On the slide of the **Menu** bar, go to **Members**, then select **Browse**

You will be redirected to the **Browser** page and can see the user list. Click on the **Gear** icon of the user you want to update role and choose **Edit** option.
