# Configure Role Permissions

This section serves as your detailed guide to customizing and fine-tuning role-based access control within the MetaFox product. This manual empowers administrators and users with elevated privileges to effectively manage and define permissions associated with various roles, ensuring a secure and tailored user experience.

Let's start by logging into your MetaFox site with the Admin user. Then go to AdminCP Dashboard > Members > Permissions

Select the **Role** you would like to configure permissions and the **App Name** to filter its available permissions. In the screenshot below, we will configure the permissions of Registered Users on the Blog app.

You can toggle the option of certain permission to enable or disable that permission on the chosen user role.

Click the **Save Changes** button to apply your configuration.

### Configure permissions within App Settings

In the other way, some apps, such as Events, Blogs, etc., may support configuring permission directly within their App Settings area for convenience.

For example, you can configure the permissions of the Blog app by going to **AdminCP** > **App Settings** > **Blog** > **Permissions**

That's all.
