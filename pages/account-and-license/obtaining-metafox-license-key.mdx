# Obtaining MetaFox License Key

License keys and License ID, also known as software serial keys, are widely used for software activation or re-activation when you first installed or reinstalled the product. This is important information and it will be sent to you via email when you first purchase a license.

When upgrading your site, purchasing, or posting reviews at our store, you will be asked to enter your site's License ID and Key. Here is the way to find them.

### **Method 1: Find License ID and Key under Admin CP**

From Admin cp dashboard, choose the **License Key** under the **Setting** tab from the left menu. Here you will find **License keys** and **License ID**
