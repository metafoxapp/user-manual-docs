# Set up payment gateways

Payment Gateway feature is a Core component of online transactions used in many Monetization features of MetaFox apps, such as Subscriptions, Activity Points, Marketplace, etc. Its main functionality is to securely and efficiently facilitate the transfer of payment information between a web browser/device and merchant's payment processor/bank. The Core Payment Gateway feature is supported by many phpFox payment gateway extensions such as [Paypal](https://appstore.phpfox.com/apps/paypal-payment-gateway/), [Apple Pay](https://appstore.phpfox.com/apps/apple-pay-payment-gateway/), [Google Pay](https://appstore.phpfox.com/apps/google-pay-payment-gateway/). It has been designed to be easily extendable with many other payment gateways via 3rd-party apps.
