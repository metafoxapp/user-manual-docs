# Set up Login with Tiktok

In this article, we are going to guide you to set up Login with Tiktok on MetaFox site with following steps:

-   Obtain Ticket API Key and Secret Key
-   Configure Login with Tiktok on MetaFox

### Obtain Ticket API Client Key and Secret Key

You will need to have Tiktok Developer account to get API Client Key and Client Secret key. If you haven't got one yet, please register your account at Tiktok Developer page ([https://developers.tiktok.com/](https://developers.tiktok.com/)).

Now, log into Tiktok Developer with your credentials. Then go to the **Manage Apps** section at [https://developers.tiktok.com/apps/](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps/)

Once the app is created successfully and approved, you can obtain the **Client Key** and **Client Secret** in the App Details page. We will configure these values in MetaFox to enable Login with Tiktok then.

Now, we will add 2 products within Tiktok App: **Login Kit** and **Scopes**
