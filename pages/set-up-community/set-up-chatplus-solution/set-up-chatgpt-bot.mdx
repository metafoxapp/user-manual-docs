# Set up ChatGPT Bot

In this article, we are going to guide you how to set up ChatGPT Bot on your MetaFox site.

### Prerequisites

-   The ChatGPT Bot is currently supported for [**ChatPlus**](https://appstore.phpfox.com/apps/chatplus/) only. So you will need to purchase and install ChatPlus on your site first.
-   OpenAI key is required to use APIs of OpenAI . OpenAI charges a fee for API usage. You should check [their pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) first.

### Obtain OpenAI key

Assume that you have registered your account at the OpenAI website at [https://openai.com](https://openai.com/) and subscribe an API plan that fits your needs successfully. Let's log in using your existing credentials.

Now you can generate an API key. API keys are used to authenticate your requests to OpenAI's API.

-   Go to your OpenAI account settings. You can usually find this by clicking on your account profile or settings icon.
    
-   Look for the **API Key** section and click on "Generate API Key" or a similar button to create a new API key.

Once you've generated an API key, it's crucial to keep it secure. Treat your API key like a password and never share it publicly. You can use environment variables or other secure methods to store and access your API key in your applications.

Assume that you can install the ChatGPT Bot app on your MetaFox site in AdminCP

After installing this app successfully, go to **AdminCP** > **App Settings** > **ChatGPT Bot** > **Settings** page
