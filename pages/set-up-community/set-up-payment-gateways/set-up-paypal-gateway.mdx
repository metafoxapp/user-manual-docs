# Set up Paypal gateway

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating PayPal as a payment method, enabling smooth and secure transactions.

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you will also need to create a PayPal Business Account.

## Creating a PayPal Business Account

#### Registering for a PayPal Business Account

1.  Visit the [PayPal website](https://www.paypal.com/).
2.  Sign up for a PayPal Business Account using your email address.
3.  Follow the prompts to provide necessary information and verify your account.

You will have to follow PayPal's verification process, which may include linking your bank account and confirming your identity.

## Get Paypal Client ID and Client Secret

PayPal integrations use a client ID and client secret to authenticate API calls:

-   A client ID identifies an app. 
-   A client secret authenticates a client ID so you will need to keep this secret safe.

Here's how to get your client ID and client secret:

1.  Select [Log in to Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/) and log in or sign up.
2.  Select **Apps & Credentials**.
3.  New accounts come with a Default Application in the REST API apps section. To create a new project, select **Create App** with the type of **Merchant**.
4.  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to configure in MetaFox site in the next step

After creating app successfully, in the App Details page, you can add Webhook with URL **https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/paypal/notify** (replace *yourdomain.com* with your actual domain) and check **All Events** option as shown below screenshot.
