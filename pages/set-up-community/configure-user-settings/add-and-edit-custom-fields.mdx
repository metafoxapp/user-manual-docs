# Add and edit Custom Fields

**Custom fields** in a user profile are additional data fields that you can add to a user's profile to store information beyond the standard set of user attributes, such as username, email address, and password. These custom fields allow you to collect, store, and display specific information about a user on your MetaFox site. MetaFox supports the custom group "About" and some certain custom fields by default and you can have a quick look on how custom fields are displayed on user profile below.
