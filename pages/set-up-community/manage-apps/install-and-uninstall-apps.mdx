# Install and Uninstall apps

This guide aims to assist you in the process of installing apps in the AdminCP of your MetaFox site. Apps can enhance your platform's functionality, and this guide will ensure that you can install them effortlessly.

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have administrative access to the MetaFox site and you have already purchased the app licenses on the [Appstore](https://appstore.phpfox.com). 

## Install/Re-install an app

Let's log into **AdminCP** > **Apps** > **Purchased** . In this pages, all apps you have purchased will be displayed as below

Now, click on the app you want to install. For instance, we will try to install/reinstall the ChatPlus app in this guide, so we will click on the **ChatPlus** item to go to the App Details page

Click on the Install/Reinstall button to starting installing the ChatPlus app. You will need to wait for the installation to complete.

During the installation, the site will send build request to MetaFox Build service to build frontend web with the new app. Thus, it may take a few minutes for the app to display on the frontend.

After installing successfully, you can reload the AdminCP and start configuring app as your need by going to **AdminCP** > **App Settings,** search the newly installed app and accessing its settings

## Managing Installed Apps

#### Viewing Installed Apps

Navigate to the **AdminCP** > **Apps** > **Installed**. Here, you can see a list of all installed apps on your site.

#### Disabling or Enabling Apps

1.  Toggle the app's **Is Active** to "Disable" or "Enable" as required.
2.  Disabled apps won't function until re-enabled.
3.  Some apps are mandatory and cannot be inactive

#### Uninstall Apps

You can uninstall the inactive apps by going to the **AdminCP** > **Apps** > **Installed**. Then, click the **Uninstall** option and follow the prompts to complete the uninstallation process.
