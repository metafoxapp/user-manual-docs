# Live Streaming - Set up transcoder server for live videos with webcam

Livestream (Live Video) has the feature to live from directly built-in devices on your computer without the streaming software's support. Furthermore, this new feature still leverages Mux and its features to provide a smooth experience for users. In this article, we will guide you to set up the transcoder server to enable this feature.

### Requirements

-   Dedicated server/VPS/cloud server for transcoder server
-   At least 8G RAM, 4 vCPUs
-   Live Video app version 5.1 or later.

## Transcoder server setup

Firstly, the transcoder server had been built and pushed to DockerHub at [https://hub.docker.com/r/foxsystem/metafox-transcoder-livevideo](https://hub.docker.com/r/foxsystem/metafox-transcoder-livevideo). Therefore, you can update **docker-compose.yml** to have a new service - "transcoder" as below.   
**docker-compose.yml**

  

  

Moreover, to make the server operate correctly, you also have to update your **.env** to adapt a few variables that the server needs  
**.env**

  

Given that,

-   WS\_PORT and WS\_EXTERNAL\_PORT: defining the internal and external WebSocket server ports.  
-   NODE\_ENV: configures running mode for better performance.
-   JWT\_SECRET: is the key used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). You can set to any random string.
-   MFOX\_BASE\_API\_URL: specifies the API URL of MetaFox.

Finally, you can just restart the docker to apply new service by using command

  

## Proxy Setup (Optional)

You can set up web server (NginX/Apache) to proxy to transcoder service with certain domain. Here is the sample Nginx configuration to for transcoder with domain *demo-transcoder.metafox.app*

## Configure MetaFox

Now, let's go to **AdminCP** of **MetaFox** to configure Live Video with the transcoder server. Visit AdminCP > App Settings > Live Videos > Settings and configure two settings: **Allow Webcam Streaming** and **Transcoder Server Url** (see in image below).

-   Transcoder Server Url: the URL of transcoder webserver.
