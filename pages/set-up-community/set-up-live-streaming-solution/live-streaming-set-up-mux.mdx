# Live Streaming - Set up Mux

This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of setting up Mux and configure Live Video app on the MetaFox site to enable Live Streaming feature.

## Create a Mux Account and configure Mux

If you haven't already, sign up for a Mux account at [https://mux.com/](https://mux.com/). Mux provides powerful video processing capabilities, including adaptive streaming and analytics.

After registering Mux account successfully, you will need to set up Mux to get Access Token (**Client ID** and **Client Secret** ) and Webhook Secret

**Set up Access Token**

Once registered, log in to your Mux dashboard.

Navigate to "Settings": In your Mux dashboard, locate and click on the "Settings" option, typically found in the top-right corner of the page.

Choose the Access Tokens menu or within the "Settings" section, select "Access Tokens." Here, you can manage your API tokens.

Click on the "Create New Token" button to generate a new Access Token. Provide a descriptive name for the token, and you can also assign permissions to control API access as below. Then click "Create" to generate the Access Token.

Once the Access Token is generated, copy it immediately and store it securely in a safe location. This Access Token is essential for authenticating requests of your MetaFox site to the Mux API.

**Setting Up Mux Webhook**

In your Mux dashboard, go to the "Settings" section.

Within the "Settings" section, select "Webhooks." This is where you'll set up and manage your Webhooks.

Click on the "Create New Webhook" button to set up a new webhook. You'll need to provide specific details about the webhook.

Enter the URL where you want to receive the webhook notifications in the "URL to notify" field. Please fill the URL ***https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/live-video/callback/mux*** . You need to replace the ***yourdomain.com*** part the URL with the proper domain of your MetaFox site

After configuring the webhook details, click "Create Webhook.".

Then you can click on the **Show Signing Secret** of the created webhook item to get the detailed signing secret. Copy and store it for later usage
