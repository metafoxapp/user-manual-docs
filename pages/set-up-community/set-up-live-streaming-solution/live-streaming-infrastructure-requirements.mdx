# Live Streaming - Infrastructure Requirements

To operate the Live Streaming solution, on top of a one-time payment for this solution, you will need to pay a monthly fee for infrastructure and external services such as storage, video live encoding, and streaming.

The monthly cost is based on the following factors:

-   The monthly live streaming videos
-   Duration of an average live stream
-   Monthly live stream view count
-   How long does the average viewer watch

To help you control your budget more conveniently, we can give you some estimation in some certain cases:
