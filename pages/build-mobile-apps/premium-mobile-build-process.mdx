# Premium Mobile Build Process

**This article is for clients who are holding MetaFox Ultimate license. In this article, we will provide you with a completed step-by-step guide for the Premium Mobile app-building process. Please carefully review and follow each step to ensure your apps can be built with the best quality and on time.**

We assume that the Mobile API has been set up and verified properly. If not, please refer to this article to [set up Mobile API](https://docs.phpfox.com/display/FOX4MAN/How+to+set+up+Mobile+API+on+phpFox+site). You can use the [phpFox Mobile app](https://docs.phpfox.com/display/FOX4MAN/How+to+use+phpFox+Mobile+app+on+Apple+Store+and+Google+Play) to verify if Mobile API has been set up correctly or not.

### Step 1 - Initiate the Premium Mobile Build Service. 

When you kick start setting up your MetaFox site and be ready to get a mobile app of your own. You can initiate the mobile app-building process for your site, log in to **[Client Area](https://clients.phpfox.com/)** and **Submit a ticket to us**.

Note that you have to open a ticket under the account holding the MetaFox Ultimate license. You need to prepare and provide us with all the required assets we need for building your app by completely filling out this form [MetaFox Mobile App Requirements form](https://forms.gle/YR1MJ6QbnKJmtiY66).

Please check the [How to request to build your Premium Mobile app](https://docs.phpfox.com/display/MFMAN/Accounts+and+mobile+assets+to+build+mobile+apps) article for more requirements details and instructions.

### Step 2 - Verify the information and assets we received

After all the required information and assets of the mobile app are received, it takes us a little bit of time to verify your assets.

In general, the verification process usually takes **about 1 business day** to finish, but it depends and might take longer.

\- We will inform you of any invalid info or asset, then you can provide us again valid pieces.

\- If all the items are valid to our criteria, we will confirm and proceed with the next step.

### Step 3 - Build and test your mobile app

Once your mobile assets are all good and ready to proceed with the build. Our team will schedule and inform you about the detailed timeline. Normally, it takes about **2-4 business days** for us to build and test your mobile apps. After successfully building an application, it is necessary that the quality of the application is ensured to be on point. 

### Step 4 - Providing build files for testing purposes

When the build of your app is completed, now it's ready for you to review. 

You can test your iOS app via TestFlight and your Android app via AAB file. The AAB file will be delivered to you for testing. 

After installation, you can now start the app and begin your testing process. Please go through all the features and functionality of the app, if you are confused or encounter any bugs/errors/problems, please report them to us. We will help check to fix/resolve reported issues.

**Details on Resolving Issues**

At this stage, the below rules will be applied for fixing issues:

1\. We will fix **critical issues** of the mobile app which impact significantly the main functionalities or user experiences... We will examine this case by case and provide you with clear information on this.

2\. Any issue that we check and confirm is the issue of our mobile app (For instance the issues also appear in the demo mobile app), we will consider and provide you support to resolve them. However, for minor issues, the patch will be included next releases of the mobile app.  
3\. To fix issues, depending on the complexity of the issues, our team will arrange a specific timeline to resolve each issue. Please work with us on this timeline. 

### Step 5 - Resolving issues and rebuild the app (if needed)

After all the reported issues are recorded and confirmed, we will process fixing and rebuilding the app for you.

Test the app carefully and report as many issues as you can at one time in the previous step as the rebuild time is limited to **3 times**. It means you have the first build from us to test for issues/problems, then you will have another 2 builds to fix the issues you reported. 

After we fixed and rebuilt, we will distribute the app to you for verification again, and you can test the app again just like what you do in step 4 above.

falseRebuild Fee Policy

In case after 3 builds and you still figure more issues on the mobile app, you can request us to rebuild the app to fix these. But now you will be charged for the build request.

### Step 6 - Distributing apps and Publishing the app to Stores

Once you finish your internal testing process and your apps are ready for users to download, you can request to take the build service to the next step - publishing your apps to Stores.

The iOS and Android builds will be uploaded under your **Apple Developer** and **Google Developer** accounts.  You will find them on App store connect and Google play console. 

You will need to go ahead to fill in all the required app details and then submit them for app review and approval. It is necessary to note that our Mobile Build Service doesn't cover app distribution. You are supposed to work directly with the reviewer to explain their inquiries if having any.

Our Mobile Build Service doesn't include follow works:

-   Configure App Details on Apple Store and Google Play

Therefore, we are NOT responsible for app rejection due to reasons relating to site content, app details, or missing materials.

### After the upload of the builds to your Developer Account, the Build Process is finished.
