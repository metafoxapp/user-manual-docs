We need 2 invitations from your Apple account

**A. Apple Developer account**

We need to access your Apple Developer account to set up app certificates, app bundle ID and provisioning profiles.

\- If your Apple Developer account is **Personal** subscription, you **have to give us the credentials to access**. Otherwise, we are unable to proceed to build your iOS app. Since Apple requires login verification, we can schedule a quick chat at our appropriate time so you can support us to pass the login verification of the Apple Developer account.

\- If your Apple Developer account is **Organization** type, you can invite us (with account email [mobile-dev@phpfox.net](mailto:mobile-dev@phpfox.net) ) to be **Developer** role on your Apple developer account.  
Please follow [the instruction here to invite us](https://www.mobiloud.com/help/knowledge-base/adding-a-new-admin-to-your-developer-apple-com-account/) using email [mobile-dev@phpfox.net](mailto:mobile-dev@phpfox.net)

***Tips**: [Convert your Apple Developer account program from Individual to Organization](https://www.mobiloud.com/help/knowledge-base/convert-apple-developer-program-individual-to-organization/).*

**B. Apple Appstore Connect**

After building the iOS app, we will need to access your Apple Appstore Connect to upload iOS build to TestFlight so you can install and verify it.

\- After finishing, click on "**Roles**" on the left-side menu then click on "**Add Developers**". Input *"**paul.kell.353**"* and then **Submit**.

Reuse Facebook app

1. If you don't want to create a new Facebook app to host your phpFox app, and you would like to re-use your current Facebook app to preserve all data and reports on your Facebook app. You will need to notify us and give us permission to overwrite our data to your current Facebook app. Also, be ready to give us the keystore or certification on your Facebook app (You might need to request a 3rd-party developer who previously developed the app), so we can overwrite our data.

2\. Please also note that there is a high chance that once we overwrite our data, any instances which connect to use your current Facebook app will not work anymore. Have the plan to backup prior to allowing us, we will not be responsible for any failure from other apps after overwriting our data.
