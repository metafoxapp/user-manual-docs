# Build Android app with Mobile source code

This article will guide you to build your Android apps with Mobile source code

## Prerequisites

### Mobile Devices

\- Supported Android versions: 8.0+

### Development Environment

We recommend to use macOS system as a development environment because:

-   Able to develop cross platform Mobile application (Android, iOS).
-   We got tons of utilities scripts that were mainly written in Bash Script, which tested and worked compatibly only with Unix environment.

We assume that you have experiences in React Native project and how to build React Native mobile apps. Please following this [Environment Setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to set up the development environment for React Native (RN) project

-   Node version >= 16.14
-   Yarn version = 1.21.0
-   React Native version: 0.70.6

## Project structure

Folder ***packages***: contains all main RN/Javascript code

Folder ***app***: Contains entrypoint for each module section from folder \`***packages***\`. Do not change anything here, we got the script to handle these generated code

Folder ***android***: Contains Java/Kotlin native code - mostly handle native things for Android app

Folder ***scripts***: contains all utilities scripts

## Setup

### Configuration

You can update our mobile configuration and assets for Android app in:

-   Copy the ***android/app/configuration\_example.json*** to ***android/app/configuration.json*** and configure this file with proper values.
    -   Set \`enableGooglePay: true\` to enable Google Pay
-   Firebase config file ***android/app/google-services.json***
    -   Please refer this [guide](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) to download it from your Firebase project for Android app
-   KeyStore file at ***android/app/<your\_app>.keystore***
    -   Refer to this [guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing) to create your keystore file

### Mobile assets

-   Update images of app icon, logo and login background in the folder ***android/app/src/main/res*** 

-   Update splash screen: You can run following command to generate splash screen after updating app icon

\--logo-width=100 --assets-path=assets\]\] >

### Load configuration

Whenever you change the configuration files above, you need to re-run these steps again:

## Quick start

Start React Native metro package manager

Run the following commands to start Android app on Android emulator (default basing on Android Studio config)

## Other Utilities scripts - CLI

  
Build release ***app.apk*** for Android alternatively Gradle build

  
Build release ***app.bundle*** for Android alternatively Gradle bundle
