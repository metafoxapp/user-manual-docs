# Build iOS app with Mobile source code

This article will guide you to build your iOS app with Mobile source code

## Prerequisites

### Mobile Devices

\- Supported iOS versions: 13+

### Development Environment

We recommend to use macOS system as a development environment because:

-   Able to develop cross platform Mobile application (Android, iOS).
-   We got tons of utilities scripts that were mainly written in Bash Script, which tested and worked compatibly only with Unix environment.

We assume that you have experience in React Native projects and how to build React Native mobile apps. Please following this [Environment Setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to set up the development environment for React Native (RN) project

-   Node version >= 18
-   Yarn version = 1.21.0
-   React Native version: 0.73.9

## Project structure

Folder ***packages***: contains all main RN/Javascript code

Folder ***app***: Contains entrypoint for each module section from folder \`***packages***\`. Do not change anything here, we got the script to handle these generated code

Folder ***ios***: Contains ObjectiveC/Swift native code - mostly handle native things for iOS app

Folder ***scripts***: contains all utilities scripts

## Setup

### Configuration

You can update our mobile configuration and assets for iOS app in:

-   Copy ***ios/configuration\_example.json*** to  ***ios/configuration.json*** file and configure this file with proper value
    -   Set \`merchantId\` to enable Apple Pay
-   Firebase config file ***ios/GoogleService-Info.plist***
    -   Please refer this [guide](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) to download it from your Firebase project for iOS app

### Mobile assets

-   Update images in the folder ***ios/Mobile/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset***

-   Update splash screen: You can run following command to generate splash screen after updating app icon

\--logo-width=100 --assets-path=assets\]\] >
