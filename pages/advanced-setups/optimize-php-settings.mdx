# Optimize PHP settings

You need to optimize some PHP settings in order to be  able to upload larger size files, have more connections at the same time, etc. , including:

-   Increase execution time 
    -   PHP param max\_execution\_time is 30 seconds by default. Recommended value for phpFox site is 60 seconds
-   Increase Max Upload Size 
    -   The Max Upload Size is limited by 2 PHP params: post\_max\_size and upload\_max\_filesize.  The default PHP values are 2 MB for upload\_max\_filesize, and 8 MB for post\_max\_size. You should increase 2 these params to appropriate values, specially if your phpFox site supports video upload.

In general, these PHP settings can be configured on server. If you are NOT familiar with server management, we strongly recommend you to reach out to hosting provider or technicians for assistances to configure PHP settings.

In this tutorial, I will guide you to how to update on both Nginx and Apache server.

# Nginx server

## Changes in php.ini

On CentOS: php.ini is saved in: */etc/php.ini*

On Ubuntu: php.ini is saved in: */etc/php/8.1/fpm/php.ini* (which 8.1 is php version that installed in your server)

bashtrue

*(Increase php execution time to 3000 seconds, max upload size to 20M)*

## Changes in Nginx Config

On file nginx config for your site, add this line **fastcgi\_read\_timeout 3000;** like this:

bashtrue

*(Increase request time out to 3000 seconds). Just add this line* **fastcgi\_read\_timeout 3000;** keep default other configurations. You can preference this tutorial  for more detail

By Default, the path of nginx config is saved in */etc/nginx/nginx.conf* (CentOS) or */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* (Ubuntu)

  

## Reload NginX and PHP

Run these commands:

bashtrue
