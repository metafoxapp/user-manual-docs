# Prepare for Installation with docker

MetaFox can be set up and installed quickly with **Docker**. Assume that your server supports Docker and Docker Compose with Linux docker images. In this guide, we are going to walk you though steps to install MetaFox site

After downloading the MetaFox package in Client Area, you can extract the MetaFox package to the */path/to/metafox* folder on your local machine or server having Docker. You can follow this guide to quickly start MetaFox site with docker:

-   Modify the *database name*, *user* and *password* in the file `server.env` under `/path/to/metafox/docker` folder if needed. The database info will be used on the Installation Wizard when installing MetaFox later. Note that the database *host name* is **postgres .** Below is the sample config of file server.env

-   Open terminal, log in to your server with SSH user having permission to run docker
-   Go to the folder that the package has been extracted to
-   Run following command in terminal:
