# Update MetaFox

MetaFox site can be updated easily and quickly in 2 ways:

-   Update in AdminCP 
-   Update manually

Before updating MetaFox site, please create full backup first so you can restore your site if having any problems during the Product Update process. MetaFox already supports **Backup** feature in **AdminCP** > **Maintenance** > **Backup**

Assume that you already back up your site successfully. Now, we can go ahead to update MetaFox site.

## Update in AdminCP

In AdminCP > Site status, there will be a Update link if new version is available for your site to upgrade.
